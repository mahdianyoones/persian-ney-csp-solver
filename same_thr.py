	If updatables set contains less than 6 TH or R variables, it means
	TH and R variables are already made consistent and further attempts
	would not further reduce any domain.
	
	Note that conflict set is empty since the algorithm makes all neighbors
	consistent in one-go. There are no direct culpirits in the assignment to 
	return as the conflict set.
	
	Resolving the contradictions due to this constraint are done only via
	backtracking. No backjumping is possible.
