		the assignment.
		
		Example:
		
		D1 -> R1 -> TH1 -> L1 (failes due to TH1 and D1)
		
		confset[L1] = [D1, TH1] so that jump happens to TH1 not D1
		
		Jumping must happen to the near past not distant past.
		Why would we repeat a long history? Why not jump to yesterday and
		make a tiny different decision and quicky proceed to today? If we jumped
		to the last year instead, we would have to to live a fully year again to see if
		that solves the issue or not!

		constraints are to target LEGAL assignments that contradict all

		for R1; hence, we need to prevent this very valid assignment to 
		D1 and TH1 from ever happening again.
