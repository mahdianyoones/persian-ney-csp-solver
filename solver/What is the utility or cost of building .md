What is the utility or cost of building an instrument type and not others?

If I build a Bb, then I will have the most common instrument. Its length is 59cm.

If I choose F_tall, I will have a rarely used instrument. Its length is 79cm.

If I choose F_short, I will have a rarely used instrument. Its length is 39cm.

Sorting instruments based on their commonness sounds natural.

Bb          59      4
C           53      4
A           62      3
D           47      3
G           70      2
E           42      2
F_tall      79      1          
F_short     39      1

39 42 47 53 {56} 59 62 70 79

average of lengths 
I choose Bb first and make a node out of it.
